hi there!

Proposal for today: the prototype board! Below I have shown the picture of that project:

All project files are included in folders created for separate projects. I have attached the mechanical drawings with dimensions too, see **dxf/** folder. These projects you can make at home, first you must prepare 2D view of PCB Layout by export to SVG file Front layer of PCB in b&w, make an PNG picture at 300 dpi and print it at your printer. Especially I have designed one side PCB, which will help you to make selected project or both projects by yourself.
