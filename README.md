Well..., well! Here you are! Of course, here are the Projects, My Projects, all about electronics. Especially for You, and Me.

All the attached projects concern an issue called the mechanical construction of electronic systems. I will not hide that I put here projects created with me in mind and by the way, maybe someone will find them useful.

In the construction of prototypes ...? Prototype board and contact plate. Here you will see projects specially prepared for the construction of prototypes.
